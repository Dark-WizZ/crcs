**6. Conclusion**

&emsp;The proposed dashboard design for the CRCS portal combines simplicity, minimalism, and user-friendliness to provide an intuitive and informative interface. It offers key features such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, interactive map views, and data tables with search and drill-down capabilities. This design aims to empower users with valuable insights into the cooperative ecosystem, supporting data-driven decision-making.
